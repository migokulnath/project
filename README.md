1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/migokulnath/project.git
   
 2.Set up the IoT sensors:
 
   Follow the instructions provided in the iot-sensors directory to set up your IoT devices for data collection.

 3.Set up the transit information platform:
   
   Follow the instructions provided in the transit-platform directory to deploy the web-based platform.

 4.Install Python dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

 5.Configure your database settings in config.py (if applicable).

 6.Start the Python integration script:
   
    python data_integration.py

 7.Develop and run the mobile app:
    Follow the instructions in the mobile-app directory to develop and run the mobile app for user access.

##  Usage
 Visit the web-based transit information platform to visualize traffic data and gain insights.
 Modify the Python scripts in the scripts directory to customize data integration and analysis according to your needs.

## Raspberry Pi Data Transmission Example
Below is an example output of Raspberry Pi data transmission:

$ python data_integration.py

[INFO] Sensor 1: Traffic Flow - 25 vehicles/minute
[INFO] Sensor 2: Average Speed - 40 km/h
[INFO] Sensor 3: Weather Conditions - Clear sky
[INFO] Data transmitted successfully to the platform.

##  Project Structure
iot-sensors/: IoT sensor setup instructions and code.
transit-platform/: Web-based transit information platform code.
